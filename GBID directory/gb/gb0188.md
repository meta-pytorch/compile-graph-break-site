## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
getattr with no source

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
var_getattr {self} {name}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo does not know how to access an attribute on an `nn.Module` instance that lacks a source. This is usually an internal error in Dynamo.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- This is likely to be a Dynamo bug. Please report an issue to PyTorch.
