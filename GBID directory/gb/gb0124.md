# GB0124

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Unsupported Tensor.item() call with capture_scalar_outputs=False

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
call_method {self} item {args} {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo does not support tracing `Tensor.item()` with config.capture_scalar_outputs=False.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- Set `torch._dynamo.config.capture_scalar_outputs = True` 
- or `export TORCHDYNAMO_CAPTURE_SCALAR_OUTPUTS=1` 
- to include these operations in the captured graph.
