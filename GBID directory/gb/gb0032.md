## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Custom __getattribute__ in nn.Module dict key check

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
has_key_in_generic_dict {self} {key}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo does not support checking key existence on `nn.Module` instances that have a custom `__getattribute__` method defined.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- Avoid defining `__getattribute__` in your module.
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
