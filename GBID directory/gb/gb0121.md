## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
UnspecializedNNModuleVariable missing method

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
call_method: {self} {name} {args} {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo does not support tracing method {name} of nn.Module {self.value}

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- Dynamo does not really define unspecialized nn.Module very well.
- This graph break may be difficult to debug. Please report an issue to PyTorch for assistance.
