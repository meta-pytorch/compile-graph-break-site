## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Uninitialized nn.Module

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
typestr(value)

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Attempted to trace an uninitialized nn.Module of type {typestr(value)}.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- Ensure your nn.Module instance has called `super().__init__()`.
- Dynamo has detected that tracing the code will result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled.
