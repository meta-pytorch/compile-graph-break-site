## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Tensor subclass overridden method call

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
{name}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
`torch.compile` currently can't trace this

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- Avoid calling {name} of tensor subclass in torch.compile region
- Renaming method `{name}` of type {self.class_type}
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
