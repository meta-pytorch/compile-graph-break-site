# GB0139

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Unsupported autograd.Function context method

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
call_method {self} {name}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo does not support calling the method `{name}` on `autograd.Function` context objects. Supported methods are `__setattr__`, `save_for_backward` and `mark_non_differentiable`.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
