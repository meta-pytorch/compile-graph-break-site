# GB0138

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Unsupported autograd.Function context `save_for_backward`

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
call_method {self} {name}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo requires the `saved_tensors` attribute to be initialized on the `autograd.Function` context object.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- Ensure that the `saved_tensors` attribute is properly 
- initialized before calling `save_for_backward`. 
- `save_for_backward` only supported on a newly constructed `torch.autograd.function.FunctionCtx`.
