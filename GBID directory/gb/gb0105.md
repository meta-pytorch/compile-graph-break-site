## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Tensor.numpy() with trace_numpy=False

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
call_method {self} numpy

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
`Tensor.numpy()` was called, but the `trace_numpy` configuration was manually disabled.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- Set `torch._dynamo.config.trace_numpy = True` to allow 
- Dynamo to trace through NumPy.
