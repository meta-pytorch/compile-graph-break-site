# GB0085

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Non-function or method in subclass of torch.autograd.Function

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
call_apply {self} {args} {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo requires the `forward` attribute of a `torch.autograd.Function` subclass to be a standard Python function or method. Found type `{type(fn).__name__}` instead.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- Ensure the `forward` method is defined as a regular 
- function or instance method.
