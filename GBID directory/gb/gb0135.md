# GB0135

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Unsupported attribute assignment on Exception object

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
call_setattr {self} {name}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo does not support setting the attribute '{name}' on tracked exception objects. Only `__context__`, `__cause__`, `__suppress_context__`, and `__traceback__` are supported.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
