# GB0123

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Unsupported Tensor.backward() call

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
call_method {self} backward {args} {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo currently does not support tracing `Tensor.backward()`.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- This graph break is fundamental - it is unlikely that Dynamo will ever be able to trace through your code. Consider finding a workaround.
