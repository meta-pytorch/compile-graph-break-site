## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
failed to call dict.fromkeys()

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
{user_cls.__name__}.fromkeys(): {args} {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Failed to call {user_cls.__name__}.fromkeys() because arguments could not be automatically converted to a list, or some dict key is not hashable.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- Manually convert the argument to a list.
- Ensure all keys are hashable.
