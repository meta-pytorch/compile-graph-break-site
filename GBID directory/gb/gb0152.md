# GB0152

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Unsupported key type for itertools.groupby

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
call_function {self} {args} {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo does not know how to trace itertools.groupby with key type: {str(type(key))}. We only support grouping keys that are constants (int, float, str, etc.)

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
