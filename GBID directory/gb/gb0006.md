# GB0006

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Attempted to call a super() attribute that is not a function or method

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
call_method {self} {name}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo does not know how to trace the call `super().{name}()` because `super().{name}` is not a function or method attribute.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- Ensure the attribute accessed via `super()` is a standard method or function.
