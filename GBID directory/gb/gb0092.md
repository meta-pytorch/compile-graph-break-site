# GB0092

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Reconstruction failure

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
str(value)

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo has no bytecode reconstruction implemented for sourceless variable {value}.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- If Dynamo is attempting to trace a return statement and your code is attempting to return a variable 
- that Dynamo cannot reconstruct, then remove it from the return statement.
- Report an issue to PyTorch if you need reconstrtuction support. Note that objects that don't have 
- reconstruction rules may be fundamentally unreconstructable.
- This graph break may have been caused by an earlier graph break. Resolving the earlier graph break may resolve this one.
