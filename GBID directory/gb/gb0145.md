# GB0145

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Unsupported custom vjp

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
call_apply {self} {args} {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo does not support tracing `torch.autograd.Function` subclasses that define a custom `vjp` method.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- Remove the custom `vjp` method if possible.
- Use standard `backward` instead if applicable.
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
