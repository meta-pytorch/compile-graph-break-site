# GB0038

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Dynamic slicing with Tensor arguments

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
SliceVariable start: {start}, stop: {stop}, step: {step}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Creating slices with Tensor arguments is not supported. e.g. `l[:x]`, where `x` is a 1-element tensor.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
