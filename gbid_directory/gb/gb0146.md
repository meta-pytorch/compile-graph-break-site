## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo doesn't support tracing the {method_name} method. We currently support wait, record, synchronize, and query.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
