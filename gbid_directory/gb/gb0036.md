*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Dynamic shape operator

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
str(cause.func)

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Operator `{cause.func}`'s output shape depends on input Tensor data.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- Enable tracing of dynamic shape operators with
