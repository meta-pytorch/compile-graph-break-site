# GB0140

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Unsupported autograd.Function method

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
call_method {self} {name}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo does not support calling the method `{name}` directly on the `torch.autograd.Function` instance. Supported methods include `apply`, `backward`, static methods, and class methods.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- Ensure the method is decorated with `@staticmethod` 
- or `@classmethod` if it's meant to be called on the class.
