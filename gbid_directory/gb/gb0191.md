## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
id() with unsupported args

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
str(args)

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo doesn't know how to trace id() call with args {args}

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- Supported args are Tensors, and functions/nn.Modules/user-defined objects 
- from outside the compiled region.
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
