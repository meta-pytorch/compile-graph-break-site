# GB0182

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
failed to broadcast when attempting Tensor comparison op

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
{op.__name__}({left}, {right})

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo was unable to broad cast the arguments {left}, {right} when attempting to trace the comparison op {op.__name__}.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- Dynamo has detected that tracing the code will result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled.
