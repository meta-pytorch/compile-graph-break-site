## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Attempted super().__delattr__() on an object without mutation tracking

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
call_method {self} {name}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo needs to track mutations on an object before `super().__delattr__` can be used on it. But the object ({self.objvar}) doesn't have attribute mutation tracking enabled.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- Ensure the object is tracked by Dynamo's side effect system.
- This is likely to be a Dynamo bug. Please report an issue to PyTorch.
