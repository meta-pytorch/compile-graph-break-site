## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Length mismatch when unpacking object for UNPACK_SEQUENCE

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
expected length: {inst.argval}, actual: {len(val)}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
{seq} unpacked to a list for the UNPACK_SEQUENCE bytecode (i.e. `a, b, c = d`) with unexpected length.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- This is likely to be a Dynamo bug. Please report an issue to PyTorch.
