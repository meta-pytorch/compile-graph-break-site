## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Failed to construct Enum variable

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
value: {value_vt}, allowed enum values: {list(cls_type)}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Attempted to construct an Enum value that is non-constant (e.g. int, string) or is not an acceptable value for the Enum. Acceptable values for Enum `{cls_type}`: {list(cls_type)}.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- Dynamo has detected that tracing the code will result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled.
