# GB0128

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Unsupported Tensor.set_() call

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
call_method {self} set_ {args} {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo currently does not support tracing `Tensor.set_()` overloads that include more than one argument.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
