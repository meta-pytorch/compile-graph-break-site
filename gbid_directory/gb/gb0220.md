## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Failed to mutate tensor data attribute to different dtype

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
setattr({obj}, {name}, {val})

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dyanmo only supports mutating `.data` of tensor to a new one with the same dtype

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- Don't mutate `.data` on this tensor, or move 
- the mutation out of `torch.compile` region
