# GB0113

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Unable to resolve super getattr

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
*No context provided.*

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo failed to trace attribute `{name}` accessed via `super()` (for type `{self.typevar}` and object `{self.objvar}`) because the resolved attribute type is not supported.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- Ensure the attribute exists in the parent class.
- Check the arguments passed to `super()`.
