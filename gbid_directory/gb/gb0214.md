*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
unsupported SymNode comparison op

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo does not support the comparison op {op.__name__} with SymNode arguments {left}, {right}

- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
