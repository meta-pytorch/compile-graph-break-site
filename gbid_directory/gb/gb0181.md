# GB0181

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
dtype mismatch between tensor and its gradient

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
tensor dtype: {value.dtype}; grad dtype: {safe_grad(value).dtype}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Inconsistent dtype between tensor and its gradient. This can happen in FSDP and crashes meta tensor creation.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
