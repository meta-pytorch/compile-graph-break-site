# GB0082

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
Missing bytecode handler

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
{opname} with args {args}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo does not know how to handle the bytecode instruction `{opname}`.

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- Do not trace code that produces the `{opname}` bytecode instruction 
- (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html for bytecode semantics).
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
