# GB0177

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*
can't handle functions not implemented in python 

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*
{fn}

## Explanation
*Why this specific graph break happened*
Dynamo can only handle functions defined in python

## Hints
*Suggestions for fixing or working around the break*
- Move usage of this function out of `torch.compile` region
- Avoid using `tensor.is_inference()` and `torch.is_inference_mode_enabled()` in your compile code. This is primarily used in conjunction with `torch.inference_mode`. Consider using `torch.no_grad` instead because `torch.no_grad` leads to same improvements as `inference_mode` when `torch.compile` is used.
