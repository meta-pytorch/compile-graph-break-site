## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

torch.cond: differing branch outputs

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

true_spec: {true_spec.treespec}, false_spec: {false_spec.treespec}, same_spec: {same_spec}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Expected branches to return the same pytree structure.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Your code may result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled. You can do this by removing the `torch.compile` call, or by using `torch.compiler.set_stance("force_eager")`.
