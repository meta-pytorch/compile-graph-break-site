## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Unsupported nn.Module attribute type

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

nn.Module subclass: {typestr(base)}, name: {name}, attribute type: {typestr(subobj)}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo does not support tracing nn.Module attributes of type `{typestr(subobj)}`

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Refactor your code so that `{name}` (type `{typestr(subobj)}`) is not an attribute of `{typestr(base)}`
- Currently supported attribute types are methods, classmethods, staticmethods, 
- properties, constants, and tensors.
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
