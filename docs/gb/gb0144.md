## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Unsupported custom jvp

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

call_apply {self} {args} {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo does not support tracing `torch.autograd.Function` subclasses that define a custom `jvp` method.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Remove the custom `jvp` method if possible.
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
