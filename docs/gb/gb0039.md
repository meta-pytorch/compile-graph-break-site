## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Dynamo recompile limit exceeded

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

Limit type: {limit_type}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo attempted to recompile the code object too many times, exceeding the {limit_type} cache size limit (currently set to {getattr(config, limit_type)}). Excessive recompilations can degrade performance due to the compilation overhead of each recompilation.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- To monitor recompilations, enable TORCH_LOGS=recompiles. 
- If recompilations are expected, consider 
- increasing torch._dynamo.config.{limit_type} to an appropriate value.
- See {troubleshooting_url} for tips on dealing with recompilations.
