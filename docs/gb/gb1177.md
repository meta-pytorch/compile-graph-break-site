## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

nn.Module mutation in HigherOrderOp

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

nn.Module: {obj}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Inplace modifying nn.Module params/buffers inside HigherOrderOps is not allowed.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Remove the mutation or move it outside of the HigherOrderOp.
- This graph break is fundamental - it is unlikely that Dynamo will ever be able to trace through your code. Consider finding a workaround.
