## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Attempted to wrap sparse Tensor

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*



## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

torch.compile does not support sparse Tensors

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Sparse tensor operations are not yet fully supported in torch.compile with fullgraph=True. Consider using fullgraph=False to allow graph breaks, or move sparse tensor creation outside the compiled region.
