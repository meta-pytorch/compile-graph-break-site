## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

1-arg super not implemented

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*



## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo failed to trace attribute `{name}` accessed via `super()` (for type `{self.typevar}` and object `{self.objvar}`) because one-argument of super() is not supported.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Use two-argument super(type, object_or_type).
