## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

id() with unsupported args

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

str(args)

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo doesn't know how to trace id() call with args {args}

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Supported args are Tensors, and functions/nn.Modules/user-defined objects 
- from outside the compiled region.
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
