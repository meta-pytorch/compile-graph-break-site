cannot resume from torch._dynamo.step_unsupported()

## Context

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

traced torch._dynamo.step_unsupported(), but Dynamo is instructed to error on graph break. This graph break is used for debugging only.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Remove the torch._dynamo.step_unsupported() call.
- Make sure fullgraph=False and error_on_graph_break=False.
- This is likely to be a Dynamo bug. Please report an issue to PyTorch.
