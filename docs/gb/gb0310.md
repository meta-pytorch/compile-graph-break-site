## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

torch.cond: improper predicate

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

str(pred)

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Expected `pred` to be a bool or a boolean tensor with a single item but got {str(type(pred))} with original python type {str(pred.python_type())}.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Dynamo has detected that tracing the code will result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled.
