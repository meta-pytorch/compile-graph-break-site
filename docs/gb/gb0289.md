## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

unsupported method call on `typing` variable

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

typing variable: {self.value}, method name: {name}, args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

`torch.compile` does not support method call `{name}` on `typing` variable f{self.value}.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Avoid calling the {name} method on {self.value}.
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
