## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

numpy function that produces a const collection type encountered non-const arguments

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

numpy function: {self.value}, args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs} (corresponding torch function: {func})

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

numpy function {self.value} that produces a const collection type (e.g. np.dtype, np.iinfo/np.finfo) received arguments that are not constant.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Dynamo has detected that tracing the code will result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled.
