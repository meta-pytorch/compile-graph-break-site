## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Unsupported `func` in itertools.accumulate

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

call_function {self} {args} {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo does not know how to get the function to use for itertools.accumulate. itertools.accumulate expects the `func` as the second argument or as a keyword argument.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Dynamo has detected that tracing the code will result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled.
