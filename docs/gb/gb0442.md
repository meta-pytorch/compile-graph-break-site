# GB0442

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

backward() with empty inputs

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

backward(inputs=[...]) resulted in no valid leaf tensors

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

backward(inputs=[...]) requires at least one valid leaf tensor.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Ensure at least one tensor in inputs is a leaf (requires_grad=True, no grad_fn)
