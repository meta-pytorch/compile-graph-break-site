## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Avoid calling `hasattr({self.__class__.__name__}, {name})` in your code.
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
