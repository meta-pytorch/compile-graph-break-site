## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

torch.compile call with > 1 args

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

args={args}, kwargs={kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Attempted to call `torch.compile` with > 1 args. Dynamo does not support this.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Remove the torch.compile call or its additional args.
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.


## Additional Information

<!-- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION START - Add custom information below this line -->
Example code that causes the graph break is:

```python
import torch

def g(x):
    return x + 1

@torch.compile(backend="eager") 
def f(x):
    return torch.compile(g, False)(x)

f(torch.randn(10, 10))
```

You can fix by removing the positional arguments:
```python
import torch

def g(x):
    return x + 1

@torch.compile(backend="eager") 
def f(x):
    return torch.compile(g)(x)
    # or possibly, return torch.compile(g, fullgraph=False)(x)

f(torch.randn(10, 10))
```
