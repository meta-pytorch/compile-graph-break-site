Indexing torch.Size with non-scalar tensor

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

get_item_dyn {self} {arg}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Attempted to index torch.Size with a tensor that is not a scalar constant.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Your code may result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled. You can do this by removing the `torch.compile` call, or by using `torch.compiler.set_stance("force_eager")`.
