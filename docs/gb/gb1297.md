## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Reconstruction failure (self-referential)

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

str(self)

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo tried to reconstruct sourceless variable {self}, but it is self-referential. Dynamo must manually implement reconstruction rules for self-referentiable sourceless variables.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- If Dynamo is attempting to trace a return statement and your code is attempting to return a variable 
- that Dynamo cannot reconstruct, then remove it from the return statement.
- Remove the self-reference in the variable. A self-referring list, for example, is `l = []; l.append(l)`.
- Report an issue to PyTorch if you need self-referential reconstrtuction support.
- This graph break may have been caused by an earlier graph break. Resolving the earlier graph break may resolve this one.
