## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Attempted to wrap RNN, GRU, or LSTM

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

str(value)

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo does not support RNN, GRU, or LSTM.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Set torch._dynamo.config.allow_rnn=True to enable experimental support for RNN, GRU, and LSTM in Dynamo
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
