## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Unsupported Tensor.backward() call

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

call_method {self} backward {gradient} {retain_graph} {create_graph} {inputs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo currently does not support tracing `Tensor.backward()` when trace_autograd_ops is off.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Set torch._dynamo.trace_autograd_ops=True
