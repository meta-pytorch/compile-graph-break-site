## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Frozen dataclass with missing field

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

dataclass={dataclass_cls.__name__}, field={field.name}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Cannot reconstruct frozen dataclass: field '{field.name}' was not tracked during tracing.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
