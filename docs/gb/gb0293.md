*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

attempted to trace numpy function with config.trace_numpy=False

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

numpy function: {self.value}, args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Attempted to trace numpy function {self.value} while `torch._dynamo.config.trace_numpy` was set to False.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Set `torch._dynamo.config.trace_numpy` to True to trace numpy functions.
