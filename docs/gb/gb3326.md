## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

invalid ptr argument for create_tma_descriptor

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

args = {args}, kwargs = {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Expected `ptr` argument of `create_{self.rank}d_tma_descriptor`to be from a `.data_ptr()` call, represented internally by `DataPtrVariable`

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- `torch.compile` may fail to internally represent result of `.data_ptr()` 
- with `DataPtrVariable` due to a graph break between the `.data_ptr()` call and 
- `create_{self.rank}d_tma_descriptor`. Please ensure there were no graph breaks 
- between these two calls.
