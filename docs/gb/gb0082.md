## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Missing bytecode handler

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

{opname} with args {args}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo does not know how to handle the bytecode instruction `{opname}`.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Do not trace code that produces the `{opname}` bytecode instruction 
- (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html for bytecode semantics).
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
