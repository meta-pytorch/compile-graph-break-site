## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

graph break in loop

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

frame skipped: {format_frame_info(code)}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

torch.compile detected a graph break in a for/while loop. Skipping the frame and falling back to eager, as graph breaks in loops are not supported.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- This graph break may have been caused by an earlier graph break. Resolving the earlier graph break may resolve this one.
