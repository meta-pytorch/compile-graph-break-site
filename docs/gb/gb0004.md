## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Attempted super().__delattr__() on an object without mutation tracking

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

call_method {self} {name}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo needs to track mutations on an object before `super().__delattr__` can be used on it. But the object ({self.objvar}) doesn't have attribute mutation tracking enabled.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Ensure the object is tracked by Dynamo's side effect system.
- This is likely to be a Dynamo bug. Please report an issue to PyTorch.
