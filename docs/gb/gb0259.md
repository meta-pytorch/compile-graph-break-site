## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

collections.deque() with bad iterable argument

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

args={args}, kwargs={kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Call to collections.deque() has an iterable argument that Dynamo cannot convert to a list.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Use a simpler sequence type that Dynamo can convert to a list 
- (e.g. list, tuple, list iterator, etc.)
- Dynamo has detected that tracing the code will result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled.
