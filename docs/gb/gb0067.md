## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

HOP: Unsafe side effect

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

Attempted to mutate {item}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Mutating a variable from outside the scope of this HOP is not supported.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- If the HOP is activation checkpointing (torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint), this points to a 
- side effect in forward method. Eager activation checkpointing replays that side-effect while 
- recomputing the forward in the backward. If you are ok with side-effect not replayed in the 
- backward, try setting `torch._dynamo.config.skip_fwd_side_effects_in_bwd_under_checkpoint = True`
