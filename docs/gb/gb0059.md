# GB0059

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Failed to trace builtin operator

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

builtin {fn.__name__} {arg_types} {has_kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo does not know how to trace builtin operator `{fn.__name__}` with argument types {real_arg_types} (has_kwargs {has_kwargs})

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Avoid calling builtin `{fn.__name__}` with argument types {real_arg_types}. 
- Consider using an equivalent alternative function/method to `{fn.__name__}`.
- If you are attempting to call a logging function (e.g. `print`), 
- you can try adding it to `torch._dynamo.config.reorderable_logging_functions`.
- Please report an issue to PyTorch.


## Additional Information

<!-- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION START - Add custom information below this line -->
Example code that causes the graph break is:
```python
def fn():
    print("This is a debug message inside the compiled function.")
compiled_fn = torch.compile(fn, backend="eager", fullgraph=True)
compiled_fn()
```

A sample workaround around this is:
```python
def fn():
    print("This is a debug message inside the compiled function.")

with torch._dynamo.config.patch(reorderable_logging_functions={print}):
    compiled_fn = torch.compile(fn, backend="eager", fullgraph=True)
    result = compiled_fn()
```
