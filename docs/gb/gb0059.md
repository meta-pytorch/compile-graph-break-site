## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Failed to trace builtin operator

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

builtin {fn.__name__} {arg_types} {has_kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo does not know how to trace builtin operator `{fn.__name__}` with argument types {real_arg_types} (has_kwargs {has_kwargs})

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Avoid calling builtin `{fn.__name__}` with argument types {real_arg_types}. 
- Consider using an equivalent alternative function/method to `{fn.__name__}`.
- If you are attempting to call a logging function (e.g. `print`), 
- you can try adding it to `torch._dynamo.config.reorderable_logging_functions`.
- Please report an issue to PyTorch.
