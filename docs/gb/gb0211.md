## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

torch.nn.Module with a non-function custom __getattr__

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

var_getattr {self} {name}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo detected a nn.Module object with a custom `__getattr__` method, but this method is not a standard Python function (e.g., it might be implemented in C/C++). Dynamo cannot currently trace into such non-standard `__getattr__` methods.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Avoid using objects with non-standard __getattr__ methods 
- within the compiled region. If possible, implement 
- __getattr__ as a standard Python function.
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
