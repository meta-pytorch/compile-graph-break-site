## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Can't extract message from torch._check()

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

str(message_vt)

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

The second argument of torch._check() must be a functiondefined within the torch.compile regionthat does not reference a non-local variable.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Make sure the message function is defined in the torch.compile region.
- Remove any closure variables, e.g. 
- remove references to closure variable `x` in `lambda: f'{x} failed check'`
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
