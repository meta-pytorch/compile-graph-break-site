## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

leaf_function: nn.Module argument without source

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

module type: {type(arg.value).__name__}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

leaf_function received an nn.Module argument that cannot be traced back to its origin. This typically happens when the module is created dynamically inside the compiled region.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Ensure the nn.Module is created outside the compiled function 
- and passed as an argument.
- If the module is a class attribute, access it via self.module_name.
