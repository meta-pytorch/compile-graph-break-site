as_python_constant for out_spec {out_spec}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Cannot return a nested function with closure from a compiled function. Dynamo failed to construct the function defined in the compiled region with closure objects.

## Hints

- Define the function at module scope instead of inside another function 
- Ensure that all closure variables are constants.
