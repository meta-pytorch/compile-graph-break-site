## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Attempted to wrap a set with tensors

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

Python set containing torch.Tensor elements

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo cannot trace sets of tensors. To get a stable ordering, Dynamo needs to convert the set into a list and the order might not be stable if the set contains tensors.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Use a dictionary where the keys are tensors.
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
