## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

failed to broadcast when attempting Tensor comparison op

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

{op.__name__}({left}, {right})

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo was unable to broad cast the arguments {left}, {right} when attempting to trace the comparison op {op.__name__}.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Your code may result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled. You can do this by removing the `torch.compile` call, or by using `torch.compiler.set_stance("force_eager")`.
