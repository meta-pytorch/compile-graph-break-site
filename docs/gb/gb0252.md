## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

could not find name in object's mro

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

name={name}, object type={type(self.value)}, mro={type(self.value).__mro__}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Could not find name `{name}` in mro {type(self.value).__mro__}

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Ensure the name `{name}` is defined somewhere in {self.value}'s type hierarchy.
- Your code may result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled. You can do this by removing the `torch.compile` call, or by using `torch.compiler.set_stance("force_eager")`.
