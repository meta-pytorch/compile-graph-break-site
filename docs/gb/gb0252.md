## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Attempted to use `torch.nn.Parameter()` constructor with Dynamo

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*



## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo does not support this

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Try to construct `torch.nn.Parameter()` outside the compiled region.
- If this is not possible, turn `graph_break_on_nn_param_ctor` off
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
