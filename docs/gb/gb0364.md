## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

User-defined object with overridden __hash__

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

hashing object of type={type(obj)} and variable tracker {vt}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Found a user-defined object {vt} with overridden __hash__ when attempting to hash it

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Dynamo does not support hashing user-defined objects with overridden __hash__
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
