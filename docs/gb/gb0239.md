## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Invalid use of pytree_flatten with nonstrict_trace-ed function

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

Input={input_spec_vt}, offending type <{type_name}>.

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Calling a `nonstrict_trace`-ed function where one of the inputs has been registered with a `pytree_flatten` that places an object of type <{type_name}> into the context.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Modifying the `pytree_flatten` to avoid placing the object into the context.
- Apply one of the following to <{type_name}>:

- * `torch.utils._pytree.register_constant`

- * `torch.utils._pytree.register_dataclass`

- * `torch.utils._pytree.register_pytree_node`
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
