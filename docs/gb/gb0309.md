## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

torch.cond: improper args/kwargs

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

torch.cond expects 4 positional arguments (got {len(args)}) and no keyword arguments (got {len(kwargs)}) Usage: cond(pred, cond_fn, body_fn, operands)

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Your code may result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled. You can do this by removing the `torch.compile` call, or by using `torch.compiler.set_stance("force_eager")`.
