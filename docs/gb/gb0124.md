## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Unsupported Tensor.item() call with capture_scalar_outputs=False

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

call_method {self} item {args} {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo does not support tracing `Tensor.item()` with config.capture_scalar_outputs=False.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Set `torch._dynamo.config.capture_scalar_outputs = True` 
- or `export TORCHDYNAMO_CAPTURE_SCALAR_OUTPUTS=1` 
- to include these operations in the captured graph.


## Additional Information

<!-- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION START - Add custom information below this line -->
Example code that causes the graph break is:
```python
def fn(x):
    return x.item()
```

A sample workaround around this is:
```python
def fn(x):
    return x.item()

input_tensor = torch.tensor([42.0])

# Workaround: Use a config patch to enable the required flag
with torch._dynamo.config.patch(capture_scalar_outputs=True):
    compiled_fn = torch.compile(fn, backend="eager", fullgraph=True)
    result = compiled_fn(input_tensor)
```
