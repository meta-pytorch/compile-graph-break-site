## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Attempted to pop from empty torch function mode stack

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*



## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Called `torch._C._pop_torch_function_stack` when torch function mode stack is empty.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Do not pop from empty torch function mode stack.
- Your code may result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled. You can do this by removing the `torch.compile` call, or by using `torch.compiler.set_stance("force_eager")`.
