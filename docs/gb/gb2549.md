## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

infinite generator detected

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*



## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo traced the YIELD_VALUE bytecode too many times. This could mean that we have attempted to trace an infinite generator.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- If you are sure that your generator is not infinite, please report a bug at {PT2_ISSUE_TRACKER_URL}.
- Your code may result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled. You can do this by removing the `torch.compile` call, or by using `torch.compiler.set_stance("force_eager")`.
