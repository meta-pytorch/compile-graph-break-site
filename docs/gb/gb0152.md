## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Unsupported key type for itertools.groupby

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

call_function {self} {args} {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo does not know how to trace itertools.groupby with key type: {str(type(key))}. We only support grouping keys that are constants (int, float, str, etc.)

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
