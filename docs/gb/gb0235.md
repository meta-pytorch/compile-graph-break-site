## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

`torch.nn.Parameter` with non-constant Tensor attributes

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

data={data}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo does not support this.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Ensure the Tensor argument's shape, dtype, and device are correct.
- Dynamo has detected that tracing the code will result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled.
