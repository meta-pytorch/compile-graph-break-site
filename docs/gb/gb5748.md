## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

autograd.grad with external GradientEdge

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

context

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

torch.autograd.grad() cannot be used with GradientEdge inputs passed from outside the compiled region. The GradientEdge contains a reference to an autograd node that was created before torch.compile started tracing, so Dynamo cannot trace through its computation.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Move the autograd.grad() call outside the torch.compile region.
- Or use tensor inputs directly instead of GradientEdge objects.
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
