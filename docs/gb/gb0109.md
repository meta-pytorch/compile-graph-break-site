*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Tensor.tolist() with non-integer tensor

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

call_method {self} to_list

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo currently does not support tracing `tolist()` on non-integer tensors.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Ensure the input tensor to `tolist()` is an integer 
- type (e.g., int8, int16, int32, int64).
