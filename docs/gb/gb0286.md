args={args}, kwargs={kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Expected valid string/torch.device argument ('cpu', 'cuda', etc.)

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Your code may result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled. You can do this by removing the `torch.compile` call, or by using `torch.compiler.set_stance("force_eager")`.
