## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Data dependent operator

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

str(cause.func)

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Operator `{cause.func}` has a non-Tensor output whose value is dependent on the data of Tensor inputs.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

*No hints provided.*


## Additional Information

<!-- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION START - Add custom information below this line -->
Example code that causes the graph break is:
```python
def fn(x):
    return torch.equal(x, x)
```
A sample workaround around this is:
```python
def fn(x):
    return torch.equal(x, x)

input_tensor = torch.ones(5)

# Workaround: Allow graph breaks by using the default fullgraph=False.
# Dynamo will run torch.equal in eager and compile what it can around it.
compiled_fn = torch.compile(fn, backend="eager")
result = compiled_fn(input_tensor)
```
