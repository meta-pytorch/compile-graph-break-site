# GB4197

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Unsupported Tensor.share_memory_() call

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

call_method {self} share_memory_

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo does not support Tensor.share_memory_() which modifies tensor storage for IPC

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Move share_memory_() call outside the compiled region. 
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
