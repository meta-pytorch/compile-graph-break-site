Failed to unpack object for UNPACK_SEQUENCE

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

str(seq)

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

{seq} cannot be unpacked into a list for the UNPACK_SEQUENCE bytecode (i.e. `a, b, c = d`).

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Dynamo has detected that tracing the code will result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled.
