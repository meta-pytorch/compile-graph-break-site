## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

call_method on generator

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

object={self.value}, method={name}, args={args}, kwargs={kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Detected a method call to a user-defined generator object. This is not fully supported.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Set `torch._dynamo.config.enable_faithful_generator_behavior = False`. Note that this 
- may cause silent incorrectness, since we will eagerly unpack generators instead of lazily 
- evaluating them.
