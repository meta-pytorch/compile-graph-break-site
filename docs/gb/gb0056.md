## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Failed to mutate tensor data attribute

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

setattr({obj}, {name}, {val})

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dyanmo only supports mutating `.data` of tensor created outside `torch.compile` region

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Don't mutate `.data` on this tensor, or move 
- the mutation out of `torch.compile` region
