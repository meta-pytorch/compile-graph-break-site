## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

unsupported Tensor comparison op

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

{op.__name__}({left}, {right})

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo does not support the comparison op {op.__name__} with Tensor arguments {left}, {right}

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
