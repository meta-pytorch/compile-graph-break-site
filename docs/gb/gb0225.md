## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Attempted to use tensor creation function with requires_grad=True

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

fn={self.value}, args={args}, kwargs={kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo does not support this.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Create the tensor outside the compiled region.
- Do not set `requires_grad=True`.
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
