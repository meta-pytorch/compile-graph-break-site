## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

torch.scan: zero-sized tensor

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

str(xs_vars[0])

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

associative_scan() operator doesn't support zero-sized tensors during tracing.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Your code may result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled. You can do this by removing the `torch.compile` call, or by using `torch.compiler.set_stance("force_eager")`.
