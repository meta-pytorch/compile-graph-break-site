## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Dynamo cannot determine the equality comparison of an object

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

is_python_equal {self}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo does not know the equality comparison of the underlying python object for {self}

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Consider using a different type of object as the dictionary key instead of {self.python_type()}.
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
