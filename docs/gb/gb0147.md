## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Unsupported function call

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

call_function {self} {args} {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo does not know how to trace the function `{self.debug_repr()}`

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Avoid calling `{self.debug_repr()}` in your code.
- Please report an issue to PyTorch.


## Additional Information

<!-- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION START - Add custom information below this line -->
Example code that causes the graph break is:
```python
def fn(it):
    return [x + 1 for x in it()]
unsupported_callable = zip
compiled_fn = torch.compile(fn, backend="eager", fullgraph=True)
compiled_fn(lambda: unsupported_callable(range(5), range(10)))
```

A sample workaround around this is instead of passing the zip type, create the zip iterator instance and iterate over it correctly (without the extra () call). This avoids the unsupported function call entirely:
```python
def fn_fixed(iterator):
    return [item[0] + item[1] for item in iterator]

# An instance of a zip iterator is created and passed as the argument.
iterator_instance = zip(range(5), range(10))

# This now compiles successfully
compiled_fn = torch.compile(fn_fixed, backend="eager", fullgraph=True)
result = compiled_fn(iterator_instance)
```
