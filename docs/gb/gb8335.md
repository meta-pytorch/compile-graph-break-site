# GB8335

## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Generator reconstruction with mutations

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

mutating object: {item}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Cannot reconstruct a generator with variable mutations. Dynamo needs to fully exhaust the generator, which may cause unintended variable modifications.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Remove mutations from the generator.
- This graph break is fundamental - it is unlikely that Dynamo will ever be able to trace through your code. Consider finding a workaround.
