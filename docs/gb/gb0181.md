## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

dtype mismatch between tensor and its gradient

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

tensor dtype: {value.dtype}; grad dtype: {grad_str}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Inconsistent dtype between tensor and its gradient. This can happen in FSDP and crashes meta tensor creation.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
