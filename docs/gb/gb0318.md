## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

torch.associative_scan: combine_fn improper number of leaves

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

str(_combine_treespec.as_python_constant())

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

combine_fn needs to produce one pytree for the output but combine_fn produces the pytree {_combine_treespec.as_python_constant()}.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Your code may result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled. You can do this by removing the `torch.compile` call, or by using `torch.compiler.set_stance("force_eager")`.
