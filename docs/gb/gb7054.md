## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

backward() with non-leaf tensor

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

backward(inputs=[...]) with non-leaf tensor: {var}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

backward(inputs=[...]) with non-leaf tensors is not yet supported.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Only pass leaf tensors (parameters, graph inputs) to backward(inputs=...)
