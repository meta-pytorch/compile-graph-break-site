## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Unsupported autograd.Function context method

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

call_method {self} {name}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo does not support calling the method `{name}` on `autograd.Function` context objects. Supported methods are `__setattr__`, `save_for_backward` and `mark_non_differentiable`.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
