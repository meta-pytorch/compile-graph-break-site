## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

ndarray.astype(object)

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

call_method {self} {name} {args} {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

`ndarray.astype('O')` or `ndarray.astype(object)` is not supported by torch.compile, as there is no equivalent to object type in torch.Tensor. This will be executed eagerly.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- This graph break is fundamental - it is unlikely that Dynamo will ever be able to trace through your code. Consider finding a workaround.
