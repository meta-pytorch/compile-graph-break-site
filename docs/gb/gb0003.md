## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Attempt to trace generator

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*



## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Generators cannot be compiled directly with `torch.compile`.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Call a generator from inside of a non-generator Python function and 
- compile that function instead.
- This graph break is fundamental - it is unlikely that Dynamo will ever be able to trace through your code. Consider finding a workaround.
