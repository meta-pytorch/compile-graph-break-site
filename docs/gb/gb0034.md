## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Data-dependent assertion failed (cannot compile partial graph)

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

value: {value}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo has determined when encountering a data-dependent assert failure that it should not compile the partial graph.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Use `torch._assert()` to raise a hard AssertionError when the check fails. 
- This error will propagate back the user code 
- that called the compiled function (i.e. Dynamo will not trace any exception handling).
- Remove the assert statement.
- Move the assert statement outside of any context managers in order to graph break with 
- partial graph compilation (if fullgraph=False).
- This graph break is fundamental - it is unlikely that Dynamo will ever be able to trace through your code. Consider finding a workaround.
