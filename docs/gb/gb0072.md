*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Inplace op on input tensor

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*



## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Attempted to trace an inplace view op on input tensor {typestr(self.value)}.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Ensure you do not modify input tensor in place.
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
