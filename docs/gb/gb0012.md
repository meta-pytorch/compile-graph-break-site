## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Attempted to read undefined local variable (implicit)

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

LOAD_FAST {name}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Could not find an implicit local variable with name `{name}`

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- This happens in dict/list comprehensions
- Your code may result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled. You can do this by removing the `torch.compile` call, or by using `torch.compiler.set_stance("force_eager")`.
