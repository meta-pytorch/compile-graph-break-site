## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Unsupported context manager

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

Attempted SETUP_WITH/BEFORE_WITH on {ctx}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo does not know how to enter a `{ctx.python_type_name()}` context manager.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Avoid using the unsupported context manager.
- If the context manager seems like it should be supported (e.g. torch.set_grad_enabled), then 
- it may be the case that it was created outside the compiled region, which Dynamo does not support. 
- Supported context managers can cross graph break boundaries only if they are local non-closure 
- variables, or are intermediate values.
- File an issue to PyTorch. Simple context managers can potentially be supported, 
- but note that context managers can't be supported in general
