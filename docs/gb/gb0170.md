## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Data-dependent branching

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

attempted to jump with {value}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Detected data-dependent branching (e.g. `if my_tensor.sum() > 0:`). Dynamo does not support tracing dynamic control flow.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Use `torch.cond` to express dynamic control flow.
- This graph break is fundamental - it is unlikely that Dynamo will ever be able to trace through your code. Consider finding a workaround.
