## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Dynamic shape operator

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

str(cause.func)

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Operator `{cause.func}`'s output shape depends on input Tensor data.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Enable tracing of dynamic shape operators with 
- `torch._dynamo.config.capture_dynamic_output_shape_ops = True`


## Additional Information

<!-- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION START - Add custom information below this line -->
Example code that causes the graph break is:

```python
def fn():
    return torch.nonzero(torch.rand([10, 10]))
```
A sample workaround that shows you how you can fix this:

```python
def fn():
    return torch.nonzero(torch.rand([10, 10]))

with torch._dynamo.config.patch(capture_dynamic_output_shape_ops=True):
    compiled_fn = torch.compile(fn, backend="eager", fullgraph=True)
    result = compiled_fn()
```
