## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

unsupported type.__dict__['__annotations__'].__get__ call

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

call_function {self}, args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

`torch.compile` only supports calling type.__dict__['__annotations__'].__get__ on a single constant argument (i.e. a type).

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Make sure your call to type.__dict__['__annotations__'] only has 
- one positional argument (no keyword arguments).
- Make sure the argument to type.__dict__['__annotations__'] is a constant 
- (i.e. type). For example, `object`, `int`, `MyCustomClass`.
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
