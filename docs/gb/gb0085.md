## Context

call_apply {self} {args} {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo requires the `forward` attribute of a `torch.autograd.Function` subclass to be a standard Python function or method. Found type `{type(fn).__name__}` instead.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*
