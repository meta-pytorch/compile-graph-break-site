## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

setattr() on Tensor.requires_grad

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

setattr({obj}, {name}, {val})

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

setattr() on Tensor.requires_grad not supported. Mutating requires_grad can introduce a new leaf from non-leaf or vice versa in the middle of the graph, which AOTAutograd does not currently know how to handle.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
