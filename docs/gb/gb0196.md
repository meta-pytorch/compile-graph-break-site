## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Check if the key exists in the dictionary before accessing it.
- Your code may result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled. You can do this by removing the `torch.compile` call, or by using `torch.compiler.set_stance("force_eager")`.
