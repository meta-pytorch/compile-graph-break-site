## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

FakeScriptObject missing method implementation

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

value={self.value}, method={name}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

TorchScript object {self.value} doesn't define the method {name}.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Ensure the method {name} is implemented in {self.value}.
- Dynamo has detected that tracing the code will result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled.
