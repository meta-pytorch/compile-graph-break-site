## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Unsupported autograd.Function method

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

call_method {self} {name}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo does not support calling the method `{name}` directly on the `torch.autograd.Function` instance. Supported methods include `apply`, `backward`, static methods, and class methods.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Ensure the method is decorated with `@staticmethod` 
- or `@classmethod` if it's meant to be called on the class.
