*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

backward() with in-graph created tensor

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

backward(inputs=[...]) with in-graph created tensor: {var}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

backward(inputs=[...]) with tensors created inside the compiled function is not yet supported.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Only pass tensors that are inputs to the compiled function or captured from outside
