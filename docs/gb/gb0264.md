## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Attempted to use `torch.nn.Parameter()` constructor with Dynamo

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*



## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo does not support this

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Try to construct `torch.nn.Parameter()` outside the compiled region.
- If this is not possible, turn `graph_break_on_nn_param_ctor` off
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.


## Additional Information

<!-- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION START - Add custom information below this line -->
Example code that causes this graph break:
```python
import torch

@torch.compile(fullgraph=True)
def fn(x):
    param = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn_like(x))
    return param, param + x

fn(torch.randn(3, 3))
```

Try to construct `nn.Parameter()` outside the compiled region.
```python
@torch.compile(fullgraph=True)
def fn(x, param):
    return param + x

fn(torch.randn(3, 3), torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(3, 3)))
```

If this is not possible, turn `torch._dynamo.config.graph_break_on_nn_param_ctor` off (NOT RECOMMENDED):
```python
torch._dynamo.config.graph_break_on_nn_param_ctor = False

@torch.compile(fullgraph=True)
def fn(x):
    param = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn_like(x))
    return param, param + x

fn(torch.randn(3, 3))
```
