## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

invalid set_subgraph_inputs and sub_kwargs settings

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

set_subgraph_inputs: {set_subgraph_inputs}, sub_kwargs: {sub_kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

`sub_kwargs` cannot be used when `set_subgraph_inputs` is not set to 'automatic'.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Use `set_subgraph_inputs='automatic'` when passing `sub_kwargs`.
- Dynamo has detected that tracing the code will result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled.
