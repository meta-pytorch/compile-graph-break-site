## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

`torch.nn.Parameter()` with unsupported data type

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

data={data}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Called `torch.nn.Parameter()` with non-Tensor argument.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Ensure the argument to `torch.nn.Parameter()` is a `torch.Tensor`.
- Your code may result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled. You can do this by removing the `torch.compile` call, or by using `torch.compiler.set_stance("force_eager")`.
