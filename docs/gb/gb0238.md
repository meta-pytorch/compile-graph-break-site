## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Input marked with `pytree.register_constant` constructed in the `torch.compile` region

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

Input={input_spec_vt}, offending type <{type_name}>.

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Calling a `nonstrict_trace`-ed function with an input that contains an object of type <{type_name}>, which was marked with `pytree.register_constant`. However, the object was constructed _inside_ the `torch.compile` region. This is not supported.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Construct the object _outside_ the `torch.compile` region, or submit an issue to GitHub.
- It may be possible to write Dynamo tracing rules for this code. Please report an issue to PyTorch if you encounter this graph break often and it is causing performance issues.
