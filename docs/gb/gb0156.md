## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Unsupported method call

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

call_method {self} {name} {args} {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Dynamo does not know how to trace method `{name}` of class `{self.python_type_name()}`

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

*No hints provided.*


## Additional Information

<!-- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION START - Add custom information below this line -->
Example code that causes the graph break is:
```python
def fn(it):
    return [x + 1 for x in it]
iterator = zip(range(5), range(10))
compiled_fn = torch.compile(fn, backend="eager", fullgraph=True)
compiled_fn(iterator)
```
A sample workaround around this is:
By creating the zip iterator inside the function, torch.compile can trace its creation and usage from the start, avoiding the issue of handling an opaque iterator object passed across the compile boundary. This is often the most performant solution if you can refactor the code this way.

```python
# Move the creation of the iterator INSIDE the function
def fn_fixed():
    iterator = zip(range(5), range(10))
    return [item[0] + item[1] for item in iterator]
compiled_fn = torch.compile(fn_fixed, backend="eager", fullgraph=True)
result = compiled_fn()
```
Another workaround around this is to convert the Iterator to a List beforehand as such:
```python
def fn(it):
    return [item[0] + item[1] for item in it]
iterator = zip(range(5), range(10))

# Convert the iterator to a list before passing it to the compiled function
data_list = list(iterator)

compiled_fn = torch.compile(fn, backend="eager", fullgraph=True)
result = compiled_fn(data_list)
```
