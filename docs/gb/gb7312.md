## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

failed to bind arguments when attempting to inline

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

func='{func.get_name()}' {func.get_filename()}:{func.get_code().co_firstlineno}; args = {[arg.python_type() for arg in args]}; kwargs = {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Argument mismatch when attempting to trace function {func.get_name()}.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Your code may result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled. You can do this by removing the `torch.compile` call, or by using `torch.compiler.set_stance("force_eager")`.
