torch.while_loop: infinite loop detected

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

str(cond_r)

## Explanation

Infinite loop detected because while_loop's cond_fn always returns the same value {pred}.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Dynamo has detected that tracing the code will result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled.
