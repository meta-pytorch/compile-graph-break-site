## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Unsupported kwargs for itertools.accumulate

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

call_function {self} {args} {kwargs}

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Expected kwargs: 'initial', 'func', but got {','.join(set(kwargs.keys()) - {'initial', 'func'})}

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Your code may result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled. You can do this by removing the `torch.compile` call, or by using `torch.compiler.set_stance("force_eager")`.
