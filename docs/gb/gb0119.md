## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Uninitialized nn.Module

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

typestr(value)

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

Attempted to trace an uninitialized nn.Module of type {typestr(value)}.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Ensure your nn.Module instance has called `super().__init__()`.
- Your code may result in an error when running in eager. Please double check that your code doesn't contain a similar error when actually running eager/uncompiled. You can do this by removing the `torch.compile` call, or by using `torch.compiler.set_stance("force_eager")`.
