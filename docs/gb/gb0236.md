## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Invalid input type for nonstrict_trace-ed function

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

Encountered input of type <{type_name}>.

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

For `nonstrict_trace`-ed functions, only basic types (e.g., torch.Tensor, int, float) or pytree containers of those are allowed as inputs. The provided argument contains an unsupported type.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Use one of the following to register the type with pytree:

- * `torch.utils._pytree.register_constant`

- * `torch.utils._pytree.register_dataclass`

- * `torch.utils._pytree.register_pytree_node`
