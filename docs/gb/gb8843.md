## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

Opaque object member with method-type USE_REAL returned a reference-type opaque object.

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

Opaque object type: {value_type}. Method name: '{name}'

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

To properly guard reference-type opaque objects, we must lift them as inputs to the graph. In order to do this, they must all have a source, meaning they come from a global value or are an attribute of an input.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Register member '{name}' with MemberType.INLINED in 
- register_opaque_type({value_type}, members=...).
