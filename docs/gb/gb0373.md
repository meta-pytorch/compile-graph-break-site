## Graph-Break Type
*Short name describing what triggered the graph break*

autograd.grad with compiled autograd

## Context
*Values or code snippet captured at the break point*

compiled_autograd is currently enabled

## Explanation
*Explanation of why the graph break was triggered*

torch.autograd.grad() inside torch.compile is not supported when compiled autograd is enabled. These two features have conflicting requirements for how the autograd graph is traced.

## Hints
*Hints on how to resolve the graph break*

- Disable compiled autograd by removing the compiled_autograd context manager.
- Or move the autograd.grad() call outside the torch.compile region.
- Or restructure your code so autograd.grad() and compiled_autograd don't overlap.
